
A Hangman style game viewed on a single page.  some call it "a relativly difficult hangman game".


When the page loads a random word is selected from a list of 15 words.  A hint is displayed if the user clicks on the "Need Hint" button. Type a letter and press 'ENTER' twice to see if that letter is in the word you are trying to guess. The user has 6 incorrect guesses before they lose the game. If a player guesses a correct letter, a "ding" sound is played and the correctly guessed letter is displayed for the word you are trying to guess.  If guessed incorrectly, the incorrect letter is displayed on the screen.

This game gets its theme from "The Price Is Right"

When the user wins the Theme song from the price is right plays and the backgound changes to a celebratory animation.

If the user loses a sound is played to notify that you have lost and the backgound also alerts you.

The answers are comprised of a list of Hangman words that I found at https://www.prdaily.com/Main/Articles/20880.aspx
